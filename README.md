It is a location-based shopping app with product-wise searching.we have developed **ShopAround** that can search and filter the nearby shops which sell the desired products.




## Problem Statement
In India, the retail sector accounts for 10% of our country's GDP and is the only source of income for many indian households.This sector has been adversely affected due to increasing online businesses.Also, the popularity of online shopping has given rise to numerous issues faced by consumers.

- Product quality issues
- Trust issues
- Missing product information
- No trial before purchase
- Online Fraud
- Delayed Delivery
- Replacement is cumbersome

In continuation to this searching a shop which sell desired product and at reasonable rates is time consuming too as it requires lot of market research.
## Our approach to solve the problem
We have come up with the platform called **ShopAround** where buyer can search and filter the nearby shops which sell the desired products.It is a location-based shopping app with product-wise searching.

ShopAround overcomes the issues faced by consumers while shopping online.Suppose a boy named Rishi want to buy a tshirt but he don't know at which nearby shop he can get his desired product. Here **ShopAround** comes into the picture. Just he has to search for desired product on **ShopAround** and can get the list of shops where his desired product is available.

Now he can contact every seller and can compare the price of the product. Also he can try out things before purchase and be satisfied with the product quality and product information.
